        <p className="section-text">
          At the event, you are most welcomed to participate in every sort of
          activities stated that it doesn’t cause ruckus. Your radical viewpoint
          and questioning attitude will be highly welcomed. We DO NOT condone
          harassment against any participant, for any reason. Harassment
          includes deliberate intimidation and targeting individuals in a manner
          that makes them feel uncomfortable, unwelcome, or afraid. Participants
          asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
          immediately. We and the venue security will respond to harassment in
          the manner we deem appropriate, including but not limited to expulsion
          from the event with the surety that you don’t show up at any following
          events we conduct. This Code of Conduct applies to everyone
          participating at DEF CON Delhi Group (DC9111) events - from attendees
          and exhibitors to speakers, press, volunteers, and Goons. Anyone can
          report harassment. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else
          is being harassed, or have any other concerns, you can contact a Goon,
          go to the registration desk, or info booth.
